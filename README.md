# AV-Project
**open source AV project that provides understanding of different algorithms and techniques in Perception, Planning and Control.<br />**

**Setting up the hardware, installing necessary software components and testing each one if they're installed properly**  
Installing ROS on local windows machine <br />
Installing ROS on Jetson nano<br />
Installing rp lidar SDK and testing the rp lidar sensor - elaborate on sepcs of lidar, working<br />
Installing hector slam SDK and testing the Intel D435i camera - elaborate on camera specs, depth sense, uses of camera.<br />
Interfacing IMU- uses, ros topics of IMU on jetson testing<br />
Interfacing WSS- uses, ros topics of WSS on jetson testing<br />
Interfacing L293D - jetson nano- need to understand PWM, H-bridge working to control two motors. <br />

**Vehicle models**  
Vehicle models - need for vehicle model, types of vehicle models  
Terms related to vehicle dynamics - Torque, Wheel speeds, Slip, slip ratio, slip angle, steering angle, over steer, under steer  

**Sensor fusion**  
What is sensor fusion? why do we need it?
Algorithms for sensor fusion.  
EKF working, EKF implementation on IMU, LIDAR, GPS/ WSS  

**Visual odometry**  
What is odometry? uses?  
Odometry algorithms, odometry using NN- Deep neural odometry!  

**SLAM**  
Difference between SLAM and odometry!  
EKF SLAM, FAST SLAM, GRAPH SLAM implementation on AV car  

**Planning algorithms**  
Path planning vs trajectory planning vs motion planning
Optimal path planning algorithms between two points- Djiskstra's, A*, RRT, RRT* 
Simulations on matlab for each one and implementation using robot
 
**Control algorithms**     
PID, LQR, MPC control methods and differences and how can we implement them on each one of them
